My project made for the Congressional App Challenge in 2020.

VolunteerX is a platform for broadcasting volunteer opportunities to local communities. Local businesses and organizations can utilize it to find volunteers to support their operations and eager citizens can use it to find volunteer opportunities in their own community.
